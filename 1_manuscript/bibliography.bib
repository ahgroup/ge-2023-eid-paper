Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of an investigational, intranasally delivered norovirus viruslike particle (VLP) vaccine (with chitosan and monophosphoryl lipid A as adjuvants) to prevent acute viral gastroenteritis after challenge with a homologous viral strain, Norwalk virus (genotype GI.1). Healthy adults 18 to 50 years of age received two doses of either vaccine or placebo and were subsequently inoculated with Norwalk virus and monitored for infection and gastroenteritis symptoms. N Engl J Med 2011;365:2178-87. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 Massachusetts Medical Society. Results Ninety-eight persons were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive vaccine (50 participants) or placebo (48 participants), and 90 received both doses (47 participants in the vaccine group and 43 in the placebo group). The most commonly reported symptoms after vaccination were nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, and sneezing. Adverse events occurred with similar frequency among vaccine and placebo recipients. A Norwalk virus\textendash specific IgA seroresponse (defined as an increase by a factor of 4 in serum antibody levels) was detected in 70\% of vaccine recipients. Seventy-seven of 84 participants inoculated with Norwalk virus were included in the per-protocol analysis. Vaccination significantly reduced the frequencies of Norwalk virus gastroenteritis (occurring in 69\% of placebo recipients vs. 37\% of vaccine recipients, P\,=\,0.006) and Norwalk virus infection (82\% of placebo recipients vs. 61\% of vaccine recipients, P\,=\,0.05).

An understanding of the infectious dose of these viruses is important for risk assessment studies. Methods. Healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of different dosages of Norwalk virus. Eligible subjects were monitored for clinical gastroenteritis, and infection status was determined. The presence of virus in vomitus was also assessed. Results. Fifty-seven persons were enrolled; 8 received placebo and an additional 8 persons were considered to be nonsusceptible on the basis of being secretor negative. Twenty-one persons were infected (all blood group O or A), and 67\% of those infected developed viral gastroenteritis. The 50\% human infectious dose was calculated to be 3.3 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction units (approximately 1320 genomic equivalents [gEq]) for secretorpositive blood group O or A persons and 7.0 (approximately 2800 gEq) for all secretor-positive persons. The time of illness onset was inversely correlated with inoculum dose. The maximal concentration of virus shedding was higher for persons with gastroenteritis. Norwalk virus was identified in 15 of 27 (56\%) vomitus samples at a median concentration of 41 000 gEq/mL. Conclusions. The 50\% human infectious dose measured is higher than previous estimates and similar to that of other RNA viruses. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT00138476.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite accounting for approximately one fifth of all acute gastroenteritis illnesses, norovirus has received comparatively less attention than other infectious pathogens. With several candidate vaccines under development, characterizing the global economic burden of norovirus could help funders, policy makers, public health officials, and product developers determine how much attention and resources to allocate to advancing these technologies to prevent and control norovirus. METHODS: We developed a computational simulation model to estimate the economic burden of norovirus in every country/area (233 total) stratified by WHO region and globally, from the health system and societal perspectives. We considered direct costs of illness (e.g., clinic visits and hospitalization) and productivity losses. RESULTS: Globally, norovirus resulted in a total of \$4.2 billion (95\% UI: \$3.2-5.7 billion) in direct health system costs and \$60.3 billion (95\% UI: \$44.4-83.4 billion) in societal costs per year. Disease amongst children {$<$}5 years cost society \$39.8 billion, compared to \$20.4 billion for all other age groups combined. Costs per norovirus illness varied by both region and age and was highest among adults {$\geq$}55 years. Productivity losses represented 84-99\% of total costs varying by region. While low and middle income countries and high income countries had similar disease incidence (10,148 vs. 9,935 illness per 100,000 persons), high income countries generated 62\% of global health system costs. In sensitivity analysis, the probability of hospitalization had the largest impact on health system cost estimates (\$2.8 billion globally, assuming no hospitalization costs), while the probability of missing productive days had the largest impact on societal cost estimates (\$35.9 billion globally, with a 25\% probability of missing productive days). CONCLUSIONS: The total economic burden is greatest in young children but the highest cost per illness is among older age groups in some regions. These large costs overwhelmingly are from productivity losses resulting from acute illness. Low, middle, and high income countries all have a considerable economic burden, suggesting that norovirus gastroenteritis is a truly global economic problem. Our findings can help identify which age group(s) and/or geographic regions may benefit the most from interventions.},

  abstract = {Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading infectious cause of morbidity worldwide, particularly among children in developing countries. With the decline of rotavirus disease rates following introduction of rotavirus vaccines, the relative importance of norovirus will likely increase. Our objectives in this study were to determine the incidence and clinical profile of norovirus disease in Guatemala.We analyzed data from a population-based surveillance study conducted in Guatemala from 2008 through 2013. Demographic information, clinical data, and stool samples were collected from patients who presented with AGE ({$\geq$}3 liquid stools within 24 hours that initiated 7 days before presentation). Estimated incidence of hospitalized, outpatient, and total community norovirus disease was calculated using surveillance data and household surveys of healthcare use.We included 999 AGE hospitalizations and 3189 AGE outpatient visits at facilities, of which 164 (16\%) and 370 (12\%), respectively, were positive for norovirus. Severity of norovirus was milder than of rotavirus. Community incidence of norovirus ranged from 2068 to 4954 per 100000 person-years (py) in children aged\&lt;5 years. Children aged \&lt;5 years also had higher incidence of norovirus-associated hospitalization (51\textendash 105 per 100000 py) compared with patients aged {$\geq$}5 years (0\textendash 1.6 per 100000 py and 49\textendash 80 per 100000 py, respectively).This study highlights the burden of norovirus disease in Guatemala, especially among young children. These data can help prioritize development of control strategies, including the potential use of vaccines, and provide a baseline to evaluate the impact of such interventions.},

Understanding the transmission route (e.g. foodborne, waterborne, or environmental) and vehicle (e.g. shellfish or recreational water) of a norovirus outbreak, however, is of great public health importance; this information can facilitate interventions for an ongoing outbreak and regulatory action to limit future outbreaks. Towards this goal, we conducted a systematic review to examine whether published outbreak information was associated with the implicated transmission route or vehicle. Genogroup distribution was associated with transmission route and food vehicle, but attack rate and the presence of GII.4 strain were not associated with transmission route, food vehicle, or water vehicle. Attack rate, genogroup distribution, and GII.4 strain distribution also varied by other outbreak characteristics (e.g. setting, season, hemisphere). These relationships suggest that different genogroups exploit different environmental conditions and thereby can be used to predict the likelihood of various transmission routes or vehicles.},

As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can also be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the internal reliability, construct validity, and ease of administration of a gastroenteritis disease severity score, the modified Vesikari score (MVS), which does not require in-person assessment. METHODS: The MVS was created by replacing 1 variable (percent dehydration) in the original score with the need for future health care visits. We used the MVS to assess the global severity of disease in a cohort of children 3 to 48 months of age with acute gastroenteritis who were evaluated in 1 of 11 participating pediatric emergency departments. In this prospective study, caregivers recorded symptoms at home in a diary and reported the results via telephone at follow-up evaluation 14 days later. To evaluate internal reliability, we examined correlations between the items included in the score. Construct validity was evaluated by assessing the correlation between the total score and other proxy outcomes of disease severity, MVS distribution, and consistency between sites. RESULTS: A total of 455 children were enrolled, and 415 were successfully contacted for follow-up evaluation. Internal reliability was acceptable, with Cronbach's {$\alpha$} of 0.59. Disease severity was correlated with day care (P = .01) and work (P = .002) absenteeism. The MVS was normally distributed, and mean scores did not differ between the 11 sites. CONCLUSIONS: The MVS seems to measure effectively the global severity of disease in a cohort of children with acute gastroenteritis. These data support the use of the MVS as an outcome measure in future clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Norwalk virus (NV) is the prototype human virus of the family Caliciviridae. A rapid immunomagnetic capture/reverse transcription-(IMC/RT-)PCR assay was developed for the detection of NV. Immunomagnetic capture (IMC) utilizes paramagnetic beads coupled to a virus-specific antibody and allows separation of virus from contaminating materials and virus concentration in a single step. The detection limit of the developed assay was approximately 250-750 genomic equivalents/ml of 10\% stool suspension. The detection limit of the assay was not altered by the presence of excess hepatitis A virus (HAV), although non-specific binding of HAV to the paramagnetic beads was observed. A panel of 100 stools from experimental human infections was screened for NV using a previously described heat release method, an antigen ELISA, or IMC/RT-PCR. NV was detected in 65/100 of these samples by IMC/RT-PCR compared to only 38/99 by heat release and 31/95 by antigen detection ELISA. All samples that were negative by IMC were also negative by both heat release and antigen ELISA. The number of samples in which RT-PCR was inhibited was greatly reduced by the use of IMC/RT-PCR compared to the heat release method (1/100 and 16/95 samples inhibited, respectively). The ability of IMC to concentrate virus ({$>$} or =2000-fold greater than heat release) and effectively remove inhibitory substances gives this assay distinct advantages over both the heat release and antigen ELISAs.},

  abstract = {Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.},

This simple dynamic can be reproduced by a broad range of mathematical models which makes model selection and the extraction of biologically-relevant infection parameters from experimental data difficult. Results: We analyze in vitro experimental data from the literature, specifically that of single-cycle viral yield experiments, to narrow the range of realistic models of infection. In particular, we demonstrate the viability of using a normal or lognormal distribution for the time a cell spends in a given infection state (e.g., the time spent by a newly infected cell in the latent state before it begins to produce virus), while exposing the shortcomings of ordinary differential equation models which implicitly utilize exponential distributions and delay-differential equation models with fixed-length delays. Conclusions: By fitting published viral titer data from challenge experiments in human volunteers, we show that alternative models can lead to different estimates of the key infection parameters.},

  abstract = {Background In the US, noroviruses are estimated to cause 21 million cases annually with economic losses reaching \$2 billion. Outbreak investigations frequently implicate vomiting as a major transmission risk. However, little is known about the characteristics of vomiting as a symptom or the amount of virus present in emesis. Methodology and Principal Findings Emesis samples and symptomology data were obtained from previous norovirus human challenge studies with GI.1 Norwalk virus, GII.2 Snow Mountain virus, and a pilot study with GII.1 Hawaii virus. Viral titers in emesis were determined using strain-specific quantitative RT-PCR. In all four studies, vomiting was common with 40\textendash 100\% of infected subjects vomiting at least once. However, only 45\% of subjects with vomiting also had diarrhea. Most of the emesis samples had detectable virus and the mean viral titers were 8.0 x 105 and 3.9 x 104 genomic equivalent copies (GEC)/ml for GI and GII viruses, respectively (p = 0.02). Sample pH was correlated with GII.2 Snow Mountain virus detection. Conclusions and Significance Half of all subjects with symptomatic infection experienced vomiting and the average subject shed 1.7 x 108 GEC in emesis. Unlike shedding through stool, vomiting is more likely to result in significant environmental contamination, leading to transmission through fomites and airborne droplets. This quantitative data will be critical for risk assessment studies to further understand norovirus transmission and develop effective control measures. The correlation between sample pH and virus detection is consistent with a single site of virus replication in the small intestine and stomach contents becoming contaminated by intestinal reflux. Additionally, the frequency of vomiting without concurrent diarrhea suggests that epidemiology studies that enroll subjects based on the presence of diarrhea may be significantly underestimating the true burden of norovirus disease.},

  abstract = {Inoculum dose, i.e. the number of pathogens at the beginning of an infection, often affects key aspects of pathogen and immune response dynamics. These in turn determine clinically relevant outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality. Despite the general recognition that inoculum dose is an important component of infection outcomes, we currently do not understand its impact in much detail. This study is intended to start filling this knowledge gap by analyzing inoculum dependent patterns of viral load dynamics in acute infections. Using experimental data for adenovirus and infectious bronchitis virus infections as examples, we demonstrate inoculum dose dependent patterns of virus dynamics. We analyze the data with the help of mathematical models to investigate what mechanisms can reproduce the patterns observed in experimental data. We find that models including components of both the innate and adaptive immune response are needed to reproduce the patterns found in the data. We further analyze which types of innate or adaptive immune response models agree with observed data. One interesting finding is that only models for the adaptive immune response that contain growth terms partially independent of viral load can properly reproduce observed patterns. This agrees with the idea that an antigen-independent, programmed response is part of the adaptive response. Our analysis provides useful insights into the types of model structures that are required to properly reproduce observed virus dynamics for varying inoculum doses. We suggest that such models should be taken as basis for future models of acute viral infections.},

Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that foodservice and winter outbreaks were significantly associated with higher attack rates. Foodborne and waterborne outbreaks were associated with multiple strains (GI+GII). Waterborne outbreaks were significantly associated with GI strains, while healthcare-related and winter outbreaks were associated with GII strains. These results identify important trends for epidemic NoV detection, prevention, and control.},

  abstract = {This study utilizes old and new Norovirus (NoV) human challenge data to model the dose-response relationship for human NoV infection. The combined data set is used to update estimates from a previously published beta-Poisson dose-response model that includes parameters for virus aggregation and for a beta-distribution that describes variable susceptibility among hosts. The quality of the beta-Poisson model is examined and a simpler model is proposed. The new model (fractional Poisson) characterizes hosts as either perfectly susceptible or perfectly immune, requiring a single parameter (the fraction of perfectly susceptible hosts) in place of the two-parameter beta-distribution. A second parameter is included to account for virus aggregation in the same fashion as it is added to the beta-Poisson model. Infection probability is simply the product of the probability of nonzero exposure (at least one virus or aggregate is ingested) and the fraction of susceptible hosts. The model is computationally simple and appears to be well suited to the data from the NoV human challenge studies. The model's deviance is similar to that of the beta-Poisson, but with one parameter, rather than two. As a result, the Akaike information criterion favors the fractional Poisson over the beta-Poisson model. At low, environmentally relevant exposure levels ({$<$}100), estimation error is small for the fractional Poisson model; however, caution is advised because no subjects were challenged at such a low dose. New low-dose data would be of great value to further clarify the NoV dose-response relationship and to support improved risk assessment for environmentally relevant exposures.},

Both mechanisms can explain the basic dynamics of an acute infection\textemdash exponential growth of the pathogen followed by control and clearance\textemdash and can also be represented by many different differential equation models. Consequently, traditional model comparison techniques using time series data can be ambiguous or inconclusive. We propose that varying the inoculum dose and measuring the subsequent infectious load can rule out target cell depletion by the pathogen as the main control mechanism. Infectious load can be any measure that is proportional to the number of infected cells, such as viraemia. We show that a twofold or greater change in infectious load is unlikely when target cell depletion controls infection, regardless of the model details. Analyzing previously published data from mice infected with influenza, we find the proportion of lung epithelial cells infected was 21-fold greater (95\% confidence interval 14\textendash 32) in the highest dose group than in the lowest. This provides evidence in favor of an alternative to target cell depletion, such as innate immunity, in controlling influenza infections in this experimental system. Data from other experimental animal models of acute primary infection have a similar pattern.},

The mechanistic interpretations of these models include strong assumptions that warrant reconsideration: the first study includes an implicit assumption that there is no immunity to Norwalk virus among the specific study population, while the recent second study includes assumptions that such immunity could exist and that the nonimmune have no defensive barriers to prevent infection from exposure to just one virus. Both models addressed unmeasured virus aggregation in administered doses. In this work, the available data are reanalyzed using a generalization of the first model to explore these previous assumptions. It was hypothesized that concurrent estimation of an unmeasured degree of virus aggregation and important dose-response parameters could lead to structural nonidentifiability of the model (i.e., that a diverse range of alternative mechanistic interpretations yield the same optimal fit), and this is demonstrated using the profile likelihood approach and by algebraic proof. It is also demonstrated that omission of an immunity parameter can artificially inflate the estimated degree of aggregation and falsely suggest high susceptibility among the nonimmune. The currently available data support the assumption of immunity within the specific study population, but provide only weak information about the degree of aggregation and susceptibility among the nonimmune. The probability of infection at low and moderate doses may be much lower than previously asserted, but more data from strategically designed dose-response experiments are needed to provide adequate information.},

Methods In this retrospective study, the VSS score, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were analyzed in 107 hospitalized children with AG, aged 6 months to 17 years. Patients were divided into nonspecific, viral, and bacterial groups according to the pathogens detected using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Results Patients in the bacterial group had significantly higher CRP values and VSS scores compared to those in the viral group and significantly higher VSS scores compared to those in the nonspecific group (P{$<$}0.05). Patients in the viral group had significantly higher VSS scores than those in the nonspecific group (P{$<$}0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that VSS was the most effective diagnostic tool for predicting the type of pathogen (P{$<$}0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of VSS was significantly greater than that for ANC and CRP (P{$<$}0.05). At a cutoff point of 10 in the VSS, an acceptable diagnostic accuracy could be achieved for distinguishing between bacterial and viral pathogens in AG. Conclusion VSS can be considered a useful and reliable infectious marker for pediatric gastroenteritis. VSS may be a good early predictor of the type of pathogen, enabling development of a treatment plan before results from a stool culture or PCR test are available.},

  abstract = {When pathogenic microorganisms enter the human body via ingestion with food or drinking water, they encounter a system of barriers mounted by the host. In order to reach parts of the intestinal tract that are suitable forgrowth and attachment, each of the bamers must be overcome successfully. The present view on infection states that at least one of the ingested pathogens must survive to start colonization. This is the basis for dose responsemodels, used for quantitative risk assessment. In this paper, the usefulness of the Beta Poisson model for multiple barriers is corroborated. Infection is associated with the presence of elevated numbers of reproducing pathogens in the intestinal tract. This does not necessarily imply illness symptoms: when intestinal microorganisms engage in damaging activities, this may lead to illness symptoms. At the same time, these activities probably elicit defensive measures from the host, promoting the removal of pathogens and terminating infection. The duration of the period of colonization reflects the balance between the colonization potential of pathogens and the strength of host defenses. Starting from the assumption that during infection the host has a certain hazard of becoming ill, a simple dose response relation for acute gastroenteritis is developed. With the use of literature data from volunteer experiments, we show that examples can be found for three possible alternatives: an increase in the probability of illness with increasingdose, a decrease with higher doses, and a probability of illness (given infection) independent of the ingested dose. These alternatives may reflect different modes of interaction between pathogens and host.},

Data from volunteer studies indicate that virus concentrations in stool are highly variable, but systematic studies of the time-course of shedding and its individual variation are lacking. This paper quantifies norovirus shedding in a large population of 102 subjects, including asymptomatic shedders, and uses a longitudinal model to generalize shedding patterns. Enhanced surveillance for studies of transmission of norovirus in hospital outbreaks has yielded a considerable number of faecal samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic shedders, both from patients and staff. Norovirus concentrations were determined by real-time PCR. A quantitative dynamic model was fitted to the shedding data, in a multilevel Bayesian framework, to study the time-course of shedding and its variation. The results indicate that shedding in asymptomatic subjects is similar to that in symptomatic infections, both showing considerable variation in peak levels (average 105-109 /g faeces) as well as duration of virus shedding (average 8\textendash 60 days). Patients appear to shed higher numbers of virus than staff, for slightly longer durations, but the differences are too small to be significant. Given equal shedding, the greater contribution of symptomatic cases to transmission must be caused by their higher efficiency in spreading these viruses. The results of this study will be helpful for risk studies that need to quantify the deposition of virus in the environment.},
